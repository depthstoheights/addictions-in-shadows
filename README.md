# Addictions in the Shadows: Grace-Based Recovery

## üìñ Biblical Foundation
> "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death." - Romans 8:1-2

A comprehensive, shame-free addiction recovery system for believers struggling in secret with pornography, alcohol, drugs, gambling, food, or technology addictions.

## üôè Ministry Purpose
This application recognizes that addiction in the church is often hidden due to shame and fear of judgment. We believe that grace, not condemnation, leads to freedom. This tool provides a safe, private space for believers to acknowledge their struggle, track their recovery, and access biblical resources without fear of exposure or judgment.
